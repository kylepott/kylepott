### Hi, I'm Kyle ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**kylepott/kylepott** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I co-founded Decise, a digital technology consultancy and agency. We help our customers across a wide range of industries adopt and incorporate modern technology and processes to achieve remarkable outcomes. We pride ourselves in distinguished work ethic and outstanding customer service.

We build and support full-stack custom software solutions primarily in e-commerce, restaurants, analytics, and in highly regulated and complex environments, some of which requires secret clearance.  We lift out and modernize existing codebases or we build software from scratch.  We have several SaaS products we offer under different brands owned by Decise primarily focused on new AI solutions.  

In addition to custom software, we also support our clients in fully managed IT support, help desk, analytics, compliance, cyber security, and digital marketing.

Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate and we're hiring at Decise. Reach out and say hi!
