### Hi, I'm Kyle ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**kylepott/kylepott** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I co-founded Decise, a digital technology consultancy and agency. We help our customers across a wide range of industries adopt and incorporate modern technology and processes to achieve big outcomes. We pride ourselves in distinguished work ethic and outstanding customer service.

We build and support full-stack custom software solutions primarily in e-commerce, restaurants, analytics, and in highly regulated and complex environments, some of which require secret clearance.  We lift out and modernize existing codebases or we build software from scratch.  We have several SaaS products we offer under different brands owned by Decise primarily focused on new AI solutions.  

In addition to custom software, we also support our clients in digital marketing, fully managed IT support, help desk, analytics, compliance, crypto/blockchain, and cyber security.

As a software developer and lead engineer, I spend most of my days writing code and leading teams to deliver features primarily in the following languages: Angular, React, Express/Node, Swift, Kotlin, Python, Bash/Shell Scripting, and Go.  I spend most of my time working on frontend and backend applications for our customers, but I also spend a lot of time in AWS, Snowflake, and working on the Linux kernel.  Personally, I enjoy building code pipelines and using software to transform manual tasks into automated processes.  I also get to work with our clients to conduct audits, automate controls, and provide advisory services on compliance and cyber security programs.

I'm extremely grateful for our customers, partners, and team members.  I get to spend all day directly helping our customers, writing code, and finding ways for technology to solve business problems quickly and at big scale.

Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate and we're hiring at Decise. Reach out and say hi!
